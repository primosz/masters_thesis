# Takagi-Sugeno Interval Type-2 Fuzzy sets experiments

Main goal of my Master's Thesis in Applied Computer Science.

Interval Type-2 Fuzzy system is employed as a classifier with Takagi-Sugeno reasoning.

Rules are automatically induced from the data.

Parameters of the model are optimized with Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm.

### Technologies
